<h1>SaalikLok.com</h1>
<p>My personal homepage on the world wide web.
A website and blog powered built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>, and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.</p>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This marks the fourth time <code>saaliklok.com</code> has been re-written. This time, I've open sourced the code and switched from Jekyll to Eleventy. Since this is my personal site, I'm not accepting any contributions, but feel free to use any code as inspiration.</p>
