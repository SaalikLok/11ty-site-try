This was meant to be a rewrite for my new website, but I'm leaving it on GitHub for now as a playground.

I was exploring Eleventy as a new static site generator, but I ran into some struggles when compiling / hot reloading / displaying CSS changes. With that, I've decided to start the rewrite again-again with something different.
